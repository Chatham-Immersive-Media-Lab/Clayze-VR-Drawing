Course IMM313
Summer Semester 2, 2024.

## Summery: 
This Unity project is a exploration into multiple problems, both memebers (Evan and Daniel) had seperate problems to tackle. for example Evans problem:

- Virtual controllers do not always map 1-1 to real controllers in feel, design, or function.
- A user cannot tell what tool they are using from the feel in their hand.
- It is difficult for a user to let go of a VR controller with confidence

And Daniel's:

-	Use physical devices to augment tactile feedback for user interactions when 3D modeling
-	As little abstraction as possible between virtual and real mental models of the tool functionality

This project is an attempt to tackle these design problems.

## Important note on controlls.
The two main working interactions in this prototype come down to two Vive pucks. Both of these Vive pucks are attatched to physical objects (a bike pump and a tripod). Without the proper hardware that was drafted with, there will be strange artifacts. You may mime the functions of both of these pucks. Yet there is also the problem of setting up vive pucks. 

One puck is set as "Left foot" and the other as "Right foot" within: Steam Vr settings -> manage trackers

In all, moving the pump puck up and down will act as a pump for the object in the scene. The mirror puck is meant to be attached to a mini tripod the buck is mounted on. The angles for the pucks position were considered in development.

## How to:
- Open this project in Unity editor version 2022.3.34f1 or newer.
- Make sure a Steam VR compatible Headset, two Vivewands and two Vive pucks are attached. 
- Navigate to scenes
- Open Scene Showcase
- hit Play
